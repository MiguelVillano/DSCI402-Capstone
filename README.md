## Abstract
This project focuses on building a predictive model to estimate likelihood of Loan Defaults using Customer Demographic, and historical financial data. Key features include credit scores, loan amounts,  interest rate, gender, marital status and education. The project closely follows the CRISP-DM methodology for Data Science Projects, which include understanding the problem, understanding the data, processing and cleaning it, analyzing results and determining a conclusion. The project involves data preprocessing steps such as handling missing values and outliers, as well as transforming categorical variables into numerical formats suitable for model training. The models used include statistical classifiers such as Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes and machine learning algorithms including K-Nearest Neighbors, Neural Networks, and Support Vector Machines. Model performance is evaluated by testing against a testing set, split from the training set, and checking its accuracy. The final model will provide insights on which features, or combination thereof, can anticipate a Loan Default.
